'''
Write a program to implement a (16, 12)-linear code. Your program should be able to
encode and decode messages using coset decoding. Once your program is written, write
a program to simulate a binary symmetric channel with transmission noise. Compare
the results of your simulation with the theoretically predicted error probability.
